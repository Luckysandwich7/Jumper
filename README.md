# Jumper
Hangman but parachute instead. The code has 4 different classes: Director, WordBlanks, Parachute, and UnknownWordGenerator. Each class runs it's own purpose as the Director runs the whole game under the Main function. WordBlanks runs the 5 dashed unknown letters for the word and helps collect the guess that the players input for the word. The Parachute contains the life and removal of the parachute parts as guesses are wrong and helps end or continue the game depending on the Parachute life. UnknownWordGenerator holds the word bank of the 5 letter words and are randomly selected to be used each game.

Team: Ryan Alvord, Cooper Featherstone, Innocent Hove, and Njato Harizo R.

Ryan has built the code out with the 4 classes and the functions that go with those classes.
